# AM-I-MUSIC

That's great! The Music Genre Classification project is a fun and educational way to dive into machine learning, especially if you're interested in both music and AI. Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you get started:

### 1. **Understand the Problem**
   - **Objective**: Classify music tracks into different genres (e.g., rock, jazz, classical, etc.) based on audio features.
   - **Dataset**: The GTZAN dataset is a popular choice for this project. It contains 1000 audio tracks, each 30 seconds long, across 10 genres.

### 2. **Set Up Your Environment**
   - **Programming Language**: Python is commonly used for such projects.
   - **Libraries**: Install necessary libraries like:
     - `librosa` for audio analysis
     - `scikit-learn` for machine learning
     - `tensorflow` or `pytorch` if you plan to use deep learning
     - `pandas` and `numpy` for data manipulation
     - `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for visualization

   You can install these using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install librosa scikit-learn tensorflow pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
   ```

### 3. **Data Collection and Preprocessing**
   - **Download the Dataset**: You can find the GTZAN dataset online. Ensure you have the audio files and any associated metadata.
   - **Feature Extraction**: Extract features from the audio files. Common features include:
     - **Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs)**
     - **Chroma features**
     - **Spectral contrast**
     - **Tonnetz**
     - **Tempo**

   Here’s a sample code snippet to extract features using `librosa`:
   ```python
   import librosa

   def extract_features(file_path):
       audio, sample_rate = librosa.load(file_path, res_type='kaiser_fast')
       mfccs = librosa.feature.mfcc(y=audio, sr=sample_rate, n_mfcc=40)
       mfccs_scaled = np.mean(mfccs.T, axis=0)
       return mfccs_scaled

   features = []
   for file in audio_files:
       features.append(extract_features(file))
   ```

### 4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - **Visualize Features**: Use plots to understand the distribution of features across different genres.
   - **Check for Imbalance**: Ensure that the dataset is balanced across genres. If not, consider techniques like oversampling or undersampling.

### 5. **Model Selection and Training**
   - **Start with Simple Models**: Begin with simpler models like Logistic Regression or Random Forest to establish a baseline.
   - **Experiment with Deep Learning**: If you have the computational resources, try using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for potentially better performance.
   - **Cross-Validation**: Use cross-validation to evaluate your model’s performance and avoid overfitting.

   Example of training a Random Forest model:
   ```python
   from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
   from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
   from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

   X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(features, labels, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

   model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100)
   model.fit(X_train, y_train)

   predictions = model.predict(X_test)
   print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy_score(y_test, predictions)}")
   ```

### 6. **Evaluation and Tuning**
   - **Metrics**: Use accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate your model.
   - **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Use techniques like Grid Search or Random Search to find the best hyperparameters for your model.

### 7. **Deployment (Optional)**
   - **Web Application**: If time permits, you can create a simple web application where users can upload a music file and get the predicted genre.
   - **Tools**: Use Flask or Streamlit for creating the web interface.

### 8. **Documentation and Presentation**
   - **Report**: Document your process, including data preprocessing, model selection, and evaluation metrics.
   - **Presentation**: Prepare a presentation to explain your approach, challenges faced, and results.
